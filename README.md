# Will You Be My Valentine? 💌  

This project is an interactive and playful webpage designed to ask my girlfriend to be my Valentine in a fun and adorable way. The webpage features:

## Features
- ❤️ **Animated floating hearts** for a romantic atmosphere.  
- 🎭 **Yes/No buttons** with dynamic behavior—pressing "No" triggers progressively cuter messages and GIFs, while "Yes" leads to a celebratory page.  
- 🎨 **A responsive design** with a charming aesthetic, ensuring a delightful experience on any device.  
- 🖼️ **GIFs & animations** to add personality and playfulness.  

## Tech Stack
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** for a simple yet engaging frontend.
- **JavaScript event handling** for button interactions and animations.

## How It Works
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Click "Yes" for an instant celebration 🎉.
3. Click "No" to trigger progressively cuter messages and GIFs until you give in 😉.
4. Enjoy the floating hearts and adorable animations throughout! 💖
